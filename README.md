This is the algorithm of a simple inventory simulation proposed by me, the final table consists of the following outputs:

demandAct / demandaAct

invFinalAct / invFinalAct

invPromAct / invPromAct

missingAct / faltanteAct

orderAct / ordenAct

na delivery / naEntrega

deliveryAct / entregaAct 

naWait / naEspera

waitAct / esperaAct
